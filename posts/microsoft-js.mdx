A typical javascript developer might wake up and see a notification on their phone from LinkedIn (owned by Microsoft), get to work and open VSCode (developed by MS), use the command line to update their repo from Github (owned by Microsoft), they start coding, assisted by Github Copilot (developed in part by Microsoft). Then they need to add a new package so they npm install it from npm (owned by microsoft). As they code, they may use Typescript (developed and maintained by Microsoft). Finally, they may push code to Azure where their code is hosted ... then they may like to chat with the developer of the package on their discord channel (owned by MS).
