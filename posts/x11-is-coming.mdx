  While the content below may be useful to some, the Cydia repository is no
  longer available due to the maintaince overhead and my loss of interest. If

</Details>

I'm excited to announce that X11 is coming soon to iOS. Most (see below) packages and dependencies for a fully functioning X11 desktop system have been compiled and are available on Cydia for iOS 11+. All packages have been compiled for arm64 and have been tested on iOS 12.4 and iOS 13.1. This requires a jailbroken device.

This site will serve largely as documentation for building yourself. ~You can add the Cydia repo below for the deb packages. Please let me know if you run across any issues with the debs; it's likely I messed up including a library or something like that. (These aren't done just yet.)~

## How it works

At the moment, a virtual screen is accessed via a VNC client to an Xvnc instance running on the iDevice. If you're unfamiliar, Xvnc is an X server with a virtual screen that can be accessed via VNC. The best part of this is no drivers are required: it's all handled by Xvnc.

## Why

Largely just because I can. Also, I want to turn my iPad into a proper development environment, and a windowing system helps with that. It's a powerful machine with a Unix-like OS, so X11 seemed like a reasonable project. X11 allows running arbirtary applications like browsers and IDEs, assuming you can make them compile.

## Current Features

- X11 on iOS via Xvnc
- Working window managers (jwm / twm / fluxbox)
- Text editor (adie)
- Image editor (azpainter)
- OpenGL (via Mesa)
- Loads of other libraries, tools, and applications.

## Building instructions

Before you start, be sure to have an iOS SDK located at `/usr/share/iPhoneOS.sdk` for sbingner's llvm-10 to function. You can get the SDKs from theos.

The following tools/libraries are required to build the packages (unless you choose to build these yourself):
